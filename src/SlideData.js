        During LIA period, I worked on a full-stack web application using several modern technologies. 
        The project utilized React.js for the front end, and Firebase, Firestore, and FireAuth for the back end, 
        providing essential functionalities like real-time data management and user authentication. 
        
        I restructured 17 components from traditional CSS styling to Tailwind CSS, which allowed for more maintainable 
        and scalable styling. I also created a context to manage the settings for light and dark modes and implemented 
        an .env file to securely handle API keys. On the back end, I configured index.js in the Firebase functions folder 
        to handle form submissions, storing form data in Firestore and dispatching emails using EmailJS.

        The LIA program is a critical component of my full-stack development education, where theoretical learning is supplemented with real-world applications. 

        During my LIA, I worked on a comprehensive web application requiring both front-end and back-end skills. 

        This project strengthened my understanding of full-stack technologies, including React.js, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, and EmailJS, while preparing me for real-world teamwork and collaboration.
